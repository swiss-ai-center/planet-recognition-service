# Planet recognition service (BentoML)

This service provides an example of MLOps tools integration (BentoML) based on the experience presented in the MLOps guide.
_Check the [related documentation](https://docs.swiss-ai-center.ch/reference/services/planet-recognition/) for more information._

Do note: The model performance is actually not good, as the focus is on the technology stack integration rather than performace.
