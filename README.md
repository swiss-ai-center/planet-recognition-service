# Planet recognition service (BentoML)

This service provides an example of MLOps tools integration (BentoML).
It is based on the toy experience presented in the [MLOps guide](https://mlops.swiss-ai-center.ch/).

_Check the [related documentation](https://docs.swiss-ai-center.ch/reference/services/planet-recognition/) for more information._

> [!NOTE]
> The model performance and dataset quality are not actually good, as the focus of this service is to demonstrate the
> technology stack integration rather than to have a model with good performance.
